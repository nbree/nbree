### About

<!--
**nbree/nbree** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

There's probably nothing visible here, since having been a professional developer for 40+ years
almost everything I've ever done is not open source (and while I often write things that could
be, I'm generally happy just noodling on them by myself) so the repositories I have are mostly
private.
